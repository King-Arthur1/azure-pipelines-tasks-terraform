# Terraform for Azure Devops

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/chzipp/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform/_apis/build/status/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform)](https://dev.azure.com/chzipp/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform/_build/latest?definitionId=2)

This contains the Azure Devops Pipeline tasks for installing and executing terraform commands within a build or release. These tasks are intended to work on any build agent. They are also intended to provide a guided abstraction to deploying infrastructure within Azure.

This repo provides two tasks
- [Terraform Installer](TerraformInstaller#readme) - Responsible for installing terraform on a build agent
- [Terraform CLI](TerraformCLI#readme) - Responsible for executing the terraform cli commands.

See readme for each of the tasks for development setup for each.

## Release Notes

### 0.4.21

Fixed issue where warning was occurring during ensure backend operation related to `--auth-mode login` not being provided to azure cli. The auth mode will now be provided to prevent the warning message. The specific warning resolved is below.

```text
WARNING: No connection string, account key or sas token found, we will query account keys for your storage account. Please try to use --auth-mode login or provide one of the following parameters: connection string, account key or sas token for your storage account.
```

### 0.4.20

Fixed issue where azure cli operations (used to ensure backend exists) interpreted warnings as failures. Azure cli will write warnings to stderr while keeping exit code 0. In this condition, the task will no longer fail.

### 0.4.16

Add support for secure .env files. Secure variable files chosen that end in `.env` will be treated as .env files. The environment variables within the file will be emitted to the task process so that they are available to terraform.

### 0.4.14

Fixed issue where backend storage account creation would return error due to deprecated storage account kind. This was due to a change in azure storage.

### 0.4.13

Fixed issue where task would fail when using TF_LOG debug variable. When this variable was used, logging would be written to stderr even when the command was successful (i.e. exit code 0). This would cause the task to decide the command failed due to the existence of content in stderr. The fix changes the decision to be based of the exit code. This should allow for TF_LOG to be used and the task succeed when the underlying command succeeds.

### 0.4.12

Parse errors from stderr output and write to exception telemetry.

### 0.4.11

Record which command option flags were used during execution without values in telemetry.

### 0.4.10

#### Added pipeline variables that indicate last exit code and indicate if plan detected changes

This change will introduce two new pipeline variables that will be available to subsequent tasks in response to #68

The first is available after any terraform command used and is TERRAFORM_LAST_EXITCODE. This will contain the exit code emitted from the terraform executable when the task was run.

The second is available only for terraform plan and is TERRAFORM_PLAN_HAS_CHANGES. This will have either true or false as valid values and will indicate true if plan detected changes. If -detailed-exitcode is not provided in command options, this variable will always be true. However, if -detailed-exitcode is provided, then this variable will be set to false if exit code 0 (empty diff) was emitted.

### 0.4.9

#### Fixed issue where using `-detailed-exitcode` would cause terraform plan to fail

As reported in #16, the `-detailed-exitcode` option would produce exit code 2 if changes were detected. The `azure-pipelines-task-lib` library would interpret this as a failure. Now if the `-detailed-exitcode` option is provided, exit code 2 will be considered a successful execution.

### 0.4.4

#### Fixed issue that occurred for existing azure storage accounts of kind "StorageV2"

Fixed issue where errors where occurring for storage accounts that were not of kind "BlobStorage". The underlying azure cli storage account create command was being executed regardless of the storage account's existance. If the storage account existed prior to executing the command, the command would attempt to set the storage account to kind "BlobStorage" access tier "hot" and configured sku. This would result in an error when updating storage account to this configuration was not supported. Example would be updating existing storage accounts that are kind "StorageV2" to "BlobStorage". This update is not permitted.

With this change, no attempt will be made to update existing storage accounts.

### 0.4.3

#### Fix command options sequence error

Fixed issue where automatically injected `apply` command options `-auto-approve` and `-var-file` were being placed after output plan file path. Output file plan path was being provided in the Command Options input field. The auto injected options would be appended after the user provided options. The auto injected options will now be inserted ahead of user provided options. This will allow users to provide a plan path at the end of their provided options to ensure all options are ordered as terraform expects.

### 0.4.1

#### Fix VSIX Validation Error

Fixed validation error reported during marketplace upload documented with issue #35.

### 0.4.0

#### Automated azurerm backend creation

#19 Create/Ensure AzureRM Backend Storage Account

The task supports automatically creating the resource group, storage account, and container for remote azurerm backend. To enable this, select the task for the terraform init command. Check the checkbox labeled "Create Backend (If not exists)" underneath the backend type drop down. Once selected, the resource group location and storage account sku can be provided. The defaults are 'eastus' and 'Standard_RAGRS' respectively. The task will utilize AzureCLI to create the resource group, storage account, and container as specified in the backend configuration.

### 0.3.4

#### Doc Updates

- #22 Updated the overview docs to include references to destroy command support
- #32 Updated the default version of the installer to be the latest version of terraform

### 0.3.3

#### Destroy Command Support

- Added support for terraform destroy command #22 and PR #31
- Updated readme and sample env #23 and PR #24

### 0.3.1

#### Bug Fixes
Duplicated working directory input parameter was removed [#17](https://github.com/charleszipp/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform/issues/17)

### 0.3.0

#### TerraformCLI: Secure Secrets
The task now supports the ability to upload and use a variable file that contains secrets. This stores the files using the [Secure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=vsts) feature in Azure DevOps. The files are downloaded to a temporary location on the build agent while running a build or release. The file is removed from the agent after the build or release completes.

### 0.2.7

#### TerraformCLI: Support Arbitrary Command Options 
A new input has been added `Command Options` that will allow for defining command options that do not otherwise have dedicated inputs. For example, the following value could be provided in the command options field when running `validate`
```
-input=true -lock=false -no-color
```
This would result in the task executing `validate` as follows
```
terraform validate -input=true -lock=false -no-color
```
Command options will always precede any other options that are generated via dedicated input such as backend config and/or variable file. 

### 0.2.6

#### Fixed `Error: Cannot find module` Error When Executing Installer and CLI Tasks
This error was due to a packaging issue with the vsix that was introduced with the changes to shrink the vsix. The changes for the shrink has been reworked to ensure runtime dependencies are included with the vsix package.

#### Marketplace Extension Shrink
Implemented new scripts for selecting only files required for task execution to be included in vsix. See [#8 VSIX Size Too Large for Marketplace Upload](https://github.com/charleszipp/azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform/pull/9)
